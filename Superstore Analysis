INSERT INTO superstore (item_id, item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating)

#Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price.
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc
;

#Show a statistic about the item prices.
SELECT ROUND(AVG(average_rating),2),category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY AVG(average_rating) desc
;

#The code above I'm trying to see which category of items has the best rating. My original results had too many repeating decimals, so I used the ROUND() function to clean up the data. From the results, I see that Electronics was the only category that had a noticeably lower average rating. 
#I used the code below to organize the average rating by category from highest to lowest. From the results, I noticed:
#Appliances had both high and low reviews. 
#Electronics had more low reviews than high, which would explain why its average reviews were different when compared to the other categories. 
#Furnishings and Kitchen Supplies both had low, medium, and high reviews. 
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY category, average_rating desc
;


#Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 
SELECT COUNT(category)
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies'
;
#Make youre own questions and answer it using SQL. What is the rating for Smart LED TV?
SELECT item_name, average_rating
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name='Smart LED TV'
